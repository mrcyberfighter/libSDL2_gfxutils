===============================================================
SDL2_gfxutils an SDL2_gfx library helper functions set library.
===============================================================

The file to include is named: SDL2_gfxutils.h

For linking the library which dependending from the libm, the SDL2 library
and the SDL2_gfxutils library:

  $ cc program.c -lm -lSDL2 -lSDL2_gfx -lSDL2_gfxutils
 
  Or
 
  $ c++ program.c -lm -lSDL2 -lSDL2_gfx -lSDL2_gfxutils
 
  Because version 2.0.0 from SDL2_gfxutils is C++ compatible.
   
Think to read the html documentation provide with this package.

============
Installation
============

The installation process is automatize with the autotools.

  You simply have to execute 3 commands in the top folder.
 
  $ ./configure.  # Which will perform testing your system and requirement.
 
  $ make          # Which will build the binaries.
 
  $ sudo make install  # Which will install the library,
                       # the html documentation and the examples
                       # programs on your system.
 
  NOTE: the prefix is set to prefix=/usr so it work on my system.  


===========================
SDL2_gfxutils brief history
===========================

SDL2_gfxutils is issue from an collection of functions that i have implemented over the years,
everytime i had a idea of a form to generate i try to implemented it as a function generating
the sequence of coordinates or performing operations on a form.

At start i implemented my ideas with the python pygame module, which is based on the SDL library,
by start i get only the functions to set a pixel according the a radius and an angle offset,
so SDL2_gfxutils is a translation of python functions into the C language.


SDL2_gfxutils has been entirely rewritten after the first version release which suffers under severals
bugs and was not handy to use, mostly for animations.

:note: After the disaster everything are right.

=========================================
The new implementation from SDL2_gfxutils
=========================================

All forms generating functions now return a pointer on a specific
SDL2_gfxutils type compatible with the generic SDL2_gfxutils Form type.

The pointers permit to manipulate the forms for transforming or
animating (rotating, scaling, translating, mirroring) functions easily.

The pointers can be destroyed at your convienence of course.
And this mechanic is massively used in form generating functions.
So that no memory space is lost.

The generic Form type has been change to contains coordinates from type float,
instead of type int16_t,
so that the computation like rotating, scaling, translating, mirroring are now exactly executed.


The subtype Pixel members are now from type float.

+ Some functions have been removed because they become useless, because of the new pointers system.

+ Some functions have been added for replacing the missing features, with many advantages, mostly for transforming or animating forms in the SDL2 mainloop.

+ All functions have been improved, favor of the pointers mechanic.
